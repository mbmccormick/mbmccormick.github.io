<p>This has been one hell of a summer for me and I could not have dreamed up an experience like this if I tried. I'd like to finish up this series of blog posts about my internship here at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a> by quoting an email that I came across this summer that does a great job at describing what it's been like to work for this company.</p>

<p>Copied below is an email from a <a href="http://sriramk.com/blog/2011/05/leaving-microsoft.html">post</a> by <a href="http://sriramk.com/">Sriram Krishnan</a>, a former Microsoft employee:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I always imagined my last day at Microsoft will end with me being fired and getting carried out by some burly security guys as I kick and scream. And as a finishing touch, they’ll come dump my belongings on me in the parking lot as I crawl sadly away with the camera panning out to gloomy music. I’m honestly a bit surprised that hasn’t happened given all the crazy things I’ve done over the years. For some weird reason, Microsoft has been surprisingly nice to me and even chose to trust me with bigger and bigger things.</p>

<p>I joined this company before I was legally allowed to drink - it’s the only company I’ve ever worked for. At a time when I wasn’t sure what to do with my life, Microsoft gave me a place where I belonged, where I fit in. I’ve got to do some amazing things here. I got to build developer tools used by millions, consumer websites, super scalable infrastructure stuff and design APIs called a gazillion times a day. I got to travel the world and work with execs from the biggest companies in the world. I got to fulfill a childhood dream and write a book. I got interviewed in the NYTimes. I’ve done some crazy things (I once stopped a riot at a conference by quelling a 5000-strong mob) and I got to meet and hang out with my heroes.</p>

<p>Most of all, I’ve got to know some amazing people. I’ve had some great managers, mentors, colleagues and peers who have set a high bar for any future workplace to match. I’ve made so many amazing friends here who’ll be friends for life.</p>

<p>For people outside, it’s hard to understand how much of a family Microsoft can be. It’s simple really, you have everything here - the competitive siblings, the wise aunt, the supportive parents, the crazy uncle (ok - maybe more than a few crazy uncles). Above all else, a place to call home. It has been home to me for most of my adult life and leaving now feels like leaving my parent’s house to college.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>My favorite Star Trek episode of all time is a TNG episode called the “Inner Light”. (Spoiler Alert) In that episode, Picard gets to live a lifetime of experiences in the blink of an eye. In a way, that’s how my time at MSFT has been - a lifetime of experiences and people compressed into a very short time.</p>

<p>Thank you for giving me the privilege of working with you and of being a part of this remarkable company.</p>

<p>This has been the best summer of my life here at Microsoft and in Seattle. I've worked on some challenging projects and I've met some amazing friends that I look forward to seeing again next summer!</p>
