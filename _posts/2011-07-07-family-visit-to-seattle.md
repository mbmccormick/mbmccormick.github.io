Last week my family came to visit me in [Seattle](http://www.seattle.gov/living/) for a week! Mom, Dad, and Connor arrived on the 28th, the day before my Mom's birthday, and left today, the day after my birthday. It was really great to see them here for such a long time! We did a lot of fun stuff and it sounds like they all really like the city. The weather here was just phenomenal this past week for the Fourth of July.

On Wednesday, I took the bus downtown to meet my family for dinner. We went to [Il Fornaio][4], a nice Italian restaurant near their hotel. I had to work on Thursday, so my family came to visit me at [Microsoft][5] that afternoon. I showed them around [Building 92][6], we went to the [Company Store][7], and went to the [Commons][8]. After that, I showed them my apartment and we went downtown for Mom's birthday dinner at [Elliot's Oyster House][9] on the pier, which was really good. I had to work again on Friday, but afterwards, I took a bus downtown to meet them for dinner at a Mexican restaurant near their hotel and I spent the rest of the weekend with them. After dinner on Friday, we went to a [Seattle Mariners][10] game, which was a lot of fun! We took the [Link Light Rail][11] from the hotel to the stadium and back.

On Saturday we went to the enormous [REI store][14] in Seattle. Later that day we went to [Red Mill Burgers][15] in Fremont, and to [Snoqualmie Falls][16] in the afternoon. On Sunday we went to a place called the [Kingfish Cafe][17] for breakfast, it was fantastic! That day, we decided to take it easy after a long couple days of walking around the city and went in to [Bellevue][18] for the day to explore the [Lincoln Square Mall][19] and for a tour of the [Microsoft City Center][20] tower, also known as the Bing building. Monday was the Fourth of July and we went to dinner at [Toulouse Petit][21], a great creole restaurant. Later that night, we watched the fireworks over [Gas Works Park][22] from our hotel and on TV.

I had to go back to work yesterday, but I spent the night with my family downtown so I had to take a bus from Seattle to Redmond that morning. After work on Tuesday, I took a bus downtown again to meet Mom and Dad for my birthday dinner. We went back to Kingfish Cafe, my new favorite restaurant, in Capitol Hill. I had my first legal drink, though I wasn't carded, and had the ribs, with potato salad, and cornbread. For desert we shared their famous strawberry shortcake, which was too much for three people. They said they've never seen anyone finish this thing. Later that night I said goodbye to my parents and headed back to my apartment in Redmond. Luckily I am heading home next weekend to see my girlfriend, my family, and my friends for Connor's graduation party!
