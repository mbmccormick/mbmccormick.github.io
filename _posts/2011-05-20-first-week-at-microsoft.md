<p>This first week at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> has truly been something else. I love the work that I am doing and I love this company already. I&rsquo;m finding that I am very passionate about the products that I am working on, as I have true interest in this particular technology. My recruiter definitely did her research in finding a place at Microsoft where I would fit so perfectly. I could certainly get used to riding my bike to work everyday, eating lunch outside while listening to live music, and seeing snow-capped mountains when I look across campus. My mentor has been extremely helpful on both a professional and personal level, he is a really great guy.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, I spent most of the day setting up my workstation and installing the necessary software that I would need as a Program Manager for my particular team. My mentor introduced me to some people who would help me get the necessary components (keyboard, mouse, cables, etc.) for my office. I ate lunch in the <a href="https://foursquare.com/venue/47696" target="_blank">Commons</a> and stopped off to browse the <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/en_US/home" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a> on my way back to my office. That afternoon, I put in requests to be granted the necessary permissions for different systems and added myself to all the relevant distribution lists. On Tuesday night, I ordered groceries on <a href="http://fresh.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Fresh</a>. It was a very cool service and they showed up right at my doorstep before I woke up!</p>

<p>On Wednesday, my mentor and I met for a little while to discuss the Program Manager role and how that role functions on the <a href="http://lync.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Lync</a> team. I finished setting up my workstation that morning and started to review some of the onboarding materials that I received from my team, <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Microsoft Office</a> itself, and the intern coordinators. I also took the Legal 101 and Security training courses required of all new hires. Later that day I went to the Library on campus to pick up a short video on Program Management at Microsoft, which was very helpful. My mentor also had me enroll in some online courses that I would take today.</p>

<p>Yesterday I spent most of the day completing the online courses that my mentor and I enrolled me in on Wednesday. I also had an &ldquo;Intern Ramp-Up&rdquo; session at lunch, where we had a great speaker talk about some helpful tips for being successful during our internship here. Afterwards, my mentor introduced me to the rest of the team and I started to get a better idea of what my project is going to be.</p>

<p>Today, my manager returned from his conference and I met him for the first time. He&rsquo;s a great guy and got my introduced to my project, something that members of my team have a real interest in and are everonye is eager to get it included in the next release! I also attended a bunch of meetings today: team updates, spec reviews, kick-start meeting with my manager and mentor, and an &ldquo;all hands&rdquo; PM meeting, where the head of Microsoft Lync welcomed me to the group. Today was also bike to work day! As a daily bike commuter, I got free breakfast in the morning, a free bike tune-up, and I was entered to win an Amazon gift card. Tonight I have another intern event, we are going bowling in Bellevue. It should be a lot of fun and it will be good to meet some more interns. This weekend some friends and I are going to check out downtown Seattle, pending the weather.</p>
