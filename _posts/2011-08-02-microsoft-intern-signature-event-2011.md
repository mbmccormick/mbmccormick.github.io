Last week was one amazing week here in [Seattle][1] for [Microsoft Interns][2]. On Thursday night we had the Microsoft Intern [Signature Event][3] and on Friday we had the Microsoft Intern Comedy Night. Unfortunately I had to say goodbye to a few friends who were leaving for the end of their internship, but not before the event of the year for us interns.

Since about week two of our internship, we've known only the date of the Signature Event, Microsoft did a great job of keeping this under wraps. A few weeks ago we received an email invitation saying that Microsoft was hosting a barbecue and a concert for us at the [Woodland Park Zoo][6], not to be confused with the [old barbecue][7] that Microsoft used to throw at [Bill Gates][8]‘ [house][9] for interns. The email told us where we needed to be on Thursday and left out all of the other information that we've been speculating about on the Internz mailing list at work. So much speculation that the head of Microsoft's Intern Program emailed Internz asking us to stop calling the zoo.

Around 4:00pm on Thursday, we went to [Buildings 26-28][10] where we got in line to board [the busses][11], about 20 in all. We walked through the checkin station where we scanned our badges, we were given our temporary [badges for the event][12], and we boarded the bus. Once we got on the bus and got moving, we watched a cool slideshow of pictures that were oddly familiar from this summer. My friends and I were in almost all of this 30 minute video, which made me wonder how they got these pictures. It turns out that because we are friends with Fractal Panda, the Microsoft Intern mascot, they were able to find all of our pictures from the summer. The video gave us a little more insight about the night, saying "you've worked hard all summer, it's time to have some fun, tonight is a night that you will never forget".

When we arrived at the zoo, we filed through the gates and picked up [our blankets][13], which we took to [the lawn][14] where we [reserved our spots][15] for the concert. Afterwards, we took in the sights of [where we were][16]: Microsoft had a [dining area][17], the [buffet lines][18], beer and wine garden, ice cream vendors, [sweets and treats][19] tent, the zoo was ours to roam around, and the stage was sent for our mystery performer. Dinner on Thursday was [grilled chicken, grilled salmon][20], mushrooms, corn on the cob, salad, fruit platters, and all of the bread you could want. The food was awesome and so was the beer! After dinner we mingled [throughout the zoo][21] for a while and then hovered [around the stage][22].

At about 7:30pm, the event started to get underway. A speaker came out to thank us all for coming, thanked the employees who helped put on the event, and then introduced [Dave Matthews][25] as the [evening's guest][26]. Dave said that "Bill called in a favor and I said sure, I'd love to". Everyone went crazy and he played a great set for about an hour, then we convinced him to come back for a few more songs. After the concert, the speaker from before came out to talk about "a few more things" about how Microsoft is happy to have us all here for the summer and to announce that they've "one-upped last year's event" with the intern gift. This year, Microsoft worked with Dave Matthew's artist to design custom shirts for tonight's event and [custom Xbox 360s Kinect][27] for everyone.

After the announcement, we filed back out the gates where we scanned our badges to pick up our shirts and Xbox 360s and then boarded the bus back to campus. It was quite the sight, seeing about 1000 college students wandering around Redmond with Xbox 360s in their arms. Thursday was truly a night that I won't forget!

Then on Friday, the fun didn't stop! The head of [Lync Server][30] decided to host a spontaneous morale event for our team, in honor of shipping several beta products. We all went down to [Lincoln Square][31] to see the [Cowboys vs. Aliens movie][32] in the morning and get lunch afterwards. After doing a little work in the afternoon, we got back on the busses for Microsoft Intern Comedy Night, which was hosted by [my school's recruiter][33].

Friday night's event was hosted at [Club Sur][34] in the [SoDo district][35] in Seattle, a really cool comedy club. There was free food, free drinks, a bar, and a few other events before the show started. Microsoft had three great comedians perform for us and it was another great night. Around 11:00pm we boarded the busses back to campus and called it a night!

Today I just ended my last Monday at Microsoft for the summer. This week I have a surprisingly full schedule trying to drive some open issues and transition out of my role for my feature team. Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday I have several presentations and meetings about my feature and about the research project I have been doing in generating documentation for web APIs. I also have another intern event, goodbye dinner, goodbye drinks, a party, and lots and lots of packing to do. I will update again this weekend to officially close up this series of posts on my internship at Microsoft.
