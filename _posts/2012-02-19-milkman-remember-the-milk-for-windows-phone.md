Over the past week or so I have been working on my latest application for [Windows Phone][1]. It's a simple task manager application that syncs with [Remember The Milk][2], called Milkman. Milkman is a beautiful, clean interface for your Remember The Milk tasks that seamlessly integrates with the Windows Phone experience.

Milkman isn't the first Remember The Milk client for Windows Phone, [WinMilk][3] was the first application of it's kind to hit the Marketplace and currently holds a lot of the market share. However, WinMilk hasn't seen a lot of love lately and I didn't really like the interface, so I decided to write my own client and I am really happy with how it turned out. Take a look at the screenshots below for a quick overview:

You can also watch a quick video demo of [Milkman on YouTube][7].

Milkman also takes advantage of some of the more advanced features of Windows Phone "Mango" like background tasks, live tiles, launchers, and calendar reminders. Take a look at the list of features below:

*   Complete integration with Metro styling
*   Creative use of typograhy and list controls to display task information
*   Background task syncing
*   Live tile counter of tasks due today
*   Popup reminders for tasks one hour before due time
*   Location-based task reminders
*   Advanced diagnostics and error reports

You can [download Milkman][8] in the Windows Phone Marketplace today for free. I would have liked to charge for this application because it has a lot of "premium" features that other Remember The Milk clients don't have, but unfortunately Remember The Milk does not allow commercial use of their API.
