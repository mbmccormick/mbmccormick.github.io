Over the past week or so I have been working on my latest application for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank">Windows Phone</a>. It’s a simple task manager application that syncs with <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com" target="_blank">Remember The Milk</a>, called Milkman. Milkman is a beautiful, clean interface for your Remember The Milk tasks that seamlessly integrates with the Windows Phone experience.

Milkman isn’t the first Remember The Milk client for Windows Phone, <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/apps/2571dafd-7ee7-df11-a844-00237de2db9e" target="_blank">WinMilk</a> was the first application of it’s kind to hit the Marketplace and currently holds a lot of the market share. However, WinMilk hasn’t seen a lot of love lately and I didn’t really like the interface, so I decided to write my own client and I am really happy with how it turned out. Take a look at the screenshots below for a quick overview:

You can also watch a quick video demo of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zmR9IgxgDA" target="_blank">Milkman on YouTube</a>.

Milkman also takes advantage of some of the more advanced features of Windows Phone “Mango” like background tasks, live tiles, launchers, and calendar reminders. Take a look at the list of features below:
<ul>
	<li>Complete integration with Metro styling</li>
	<li>Creative use of typograhy and list controls to display task information</li>
	<li>Background task syncing</li>
	<li>Live tile counter of tasks due today</li>
	<li>Popup reminders for tasks one hour before due time</li>
	<li>Location-based task reminders</li>
	<li>Advanced diagnostics and error reports</li>
</ul>
You can <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/apps/2d14a2ea-9445-4d46-b385-8b2e45f7f6d8" target="_blank">download Milkman</a> in the Windows Phone Marketplace today for free. I would have liked to charge for this application because it has a lot of “premium” features that other Remember The Milk clients don’t have, but unfortunately Remember The Milk does not allow commercial use of their API.
