Over the past week or so I have been working on my latest application for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank">Windows Phone</a>. It's a simple task manager application that syncs with <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com" target="_blank">Remember The Milk</a>, called Milkman. Milkman is a beautiful, clean interface for your Remember The Milk tasks that seamlessly integrates with the Windows Phone experience.

Milkman isn't the first Remember The Milk client for Windows Phone, <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/apps/2571dafd-7ee7-df11-a844-00237de2db9e" target="_blank">WinMilk</a> was the first application of it's kind to hit the Marketplace and currently holds a lot of the market share. However, WinMilk hasn't seen a lot of love lately and I didn't really like the interface, so I decided to write my own client and I am really happy with how it turned out. Take a look at the screenshots below for a quick overview:

<a href="/images/2012/02/2.png" target="_blank"><img src="/images/2012/02/2.png" style="width: 150px !important;" title="Milkman's Task Details page, allowing you to view all of the information associated with a task." /></a>
<a href="/images/2012/02/7.png" target="_blank"><img src="/images/2012/02/7.png" style="width: 150px !important;" title="Milkman's location-based reminder toast, notifying you when you're near a task." /></a>

Milkman also takes advantage of some of the more advanced features of Windows Phone "Mango" like background tasks, live tiles, launchers, and calendar reminders. Take a look at the list of features below:

* Complete integration with Metro styling
* Creative use of typograhy and list controls to display task information
* Background task syncing
* Live tile counter of tasks due today
* Popup reminders for tasks one hour before due time
* Location-based task reminders
* Advanced diagnostics and error reports

You can <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/apps/2d14a2ea-9445-4d46-b385-8b2e45f7f6d8" target="_blank">download Milkman</a> in the Windows Phone Marketplace today for $0.99. This is the first application that I have charged for, only because I view this application as a "premium" application. There is a very suitable, free alternative to Milkman that will display your Remember The Milk tasks. However, if you want a cleaner interface with advanced features like location-based reminders, live tile updates, and calendar reminders, Milkman is the application for you.
