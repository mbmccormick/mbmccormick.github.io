Over the past week or so I have been working on my latest application for Windows Phone. It's a simple task manager application that syncs with Remember The Milk, called Milkman. Milkman is a beautiful, clean interface for your Remember The Milk tasks that seamlessly integrates with the Windows Phone experience.

Milkman isn't the first Remember The Milk client for Windows Phone, WinMilk was the first application of it's kind to hit the Marketplace and currently holds a lot of the market share. However, WinMilk hasn't seen a lot of love lately and I didn't really like the interface, so I decided to write my own client. Take a look at the screenshots below for a quick overview.

Milkman also takes advantage of some of the more advanced features of Windows Phone "Mango" like background tasks, live tiles, launchers, and calendar reminders. Take a look at the list of features below:

* Complete integration with Metro styling
* Creative use of typograhy and list controls to display task information
* Background task syncing
* Live tile counter of tasks due today
* Popup reminders for tasks one hour before due time
* Location-based task reminders
* Advanced diagnostics and error reports

You can download Milkman in the Windows Phone Marketplace today for $0.99. This is the first application that I have charged for, only because I view this application as a "premium" application. There is a very suitable, free alternative to Milkman that will display your Remember The Milk tasks. However, if you want a cleaner interface with advanced features like location-based reminders, live tile updates, and calendar reminders, Milkman is the application for you.
