As you may or may not know, I will be spending the summer at [Microsoft][1] in [Redmond, WA][2]. I accepted an internship position as a [Program Manger][3] with [Microsoft Lync][4], also known as the Office Voice and Video Communications Group. I am absolutely thrilled to be in [Seattle][5] this summer, working for a company that I have idolized over for as long as I can remember. I leave from Detroit for Seattle on Saturday, with New Employee Orientation on Monday. It's hard to believe, though, that it has been over 6 months to get to where I am now.

Back in October, I met with a Microsoft Recruiter at an on-campus job fair. We talked about the different internship positions that Microsoft offers and the interview process. A few weeks later, I was invited back for an on-campus interview. This was mostly a technical interview, lots of [coding and brainstorming][8]. A few weeks later, I was invited for the final round of interviews in Redmond. In mid-January, I flew out to Seattle and interviewed with four different people for about 6 hours. My brain was completely fried afterwards, as my interview consisted of a lot of [technical questions][9]. A few days after I returned from my trip, I was offered a position as a Program Manager Intern with Microsoft Lync. After accepting my offer, I was quickly introduced to an army of onboarding specialists. I think I've had about four recruiters, two relocation specialists, two travel specialists, a team contact, and just this week I met my manager and my mentor. Microsoft's [hiring program][10] alone is an logistical engineering feat. I have been thoroughly impressed with this team.

In an effort to make the most of my summer and to ensure that my customers get the attention they deserve, I decided it was best to stop new development for [my business][11] and scale down to just customer support for the next few months. I'm trying to tie up all of my remaining loose ends before I leave this weekend and I've already had to turn away new work, unfortunately.

This summer I will be living at [The Trails of Redmond][12] apartments in Redmond with one roommate. My apartment complex is one block away from [Building 30][13], which is where I will be working. Since I've decided to bike to work all summer, this will be really nice. The apartments look beautiful and come [fully furnished][14], making relocation a lot easier. I will also be a 20 minute bike ride from downtown Redmond and a short 30 minute bus ride from downtown Seattle.

I will be chronicling my internship throughout the summer, so check back for updates. I am really excited to be at Microsoft this summer. I'm also thrilled to be a member of the Microsoft Lync team. [Bill Gates][15] himself had this to say about Lync:

Microsoft is on the [forefront][16] of voice and video communications technology and it seems that I will be joining the team at a very [exciting time][17]. With Microsoft's recent acquisition of Skype, I have a feeling I will be seeing some very interesting things happening this summer.
