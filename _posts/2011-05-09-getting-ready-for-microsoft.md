As you may or may not know, I will be spending the summer at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/gallery/campus.mspx" target="_blank">Redmond, WA</a>. I accepted an internship position as a <a href="http://careers.microsoft.com/careers/en/us/collegeinternships.aspx" target="_blank">Program Manger</a> with <a href="http://lync.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Lync</a>, also known as the Office Voice and Video Communications Group. I am absolutely thrilled to be in <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/living/" target="_blank">Seattle</a> this summer, working for a company that I have idolized over for as long as I can remember. I leave from Detroit for Seattle on Saturday, with New Employee Orientation on Monday. It's hard to believe, though, that it has been over 6 months to get to where I am now.

<a href="http://mbmccormick.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_0703.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-105" title="IMG_0703" src="http://mbmccormick.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_0703-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Back in October, I met with a Microsoft Recruiter at an on-campus job fair. We talked about the different internship positions that Microsoft offers and the interview process. A few weeks later, I was invited back for an on-campus interview. This was mostly a technical interview, lots of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Secrets-Landing/dp/0471383562" target="_blank">coding and brainstorming</a>. A few weeks later, I was invited for the final round of interviews in Redmond. In mid-January, I flew out to Seattle and interviewed with four different people for about 6 hours. My brain was completely fried afterwards, as my interview consisted of a lot of <a href="http://microsoftfeed.com/2010/80-cool-microsoft-interview-questions/" target="_blank">technical questions</a>. A few days after I returned from my trip, I was offered a position as a Program Manager Intern with Microsoft Lync. After accepting my offer, I was quickly introduced to an army of onboarding specialists. I think I've had about four recruiters, two relocation specialists, two travel specialists, a team contact, and just this week I met my manager and my mentor. Microsoft's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_interview" target="_blank">hiring program</a> alone is an logistical engineering feat. I have been thoroughly impressed with this team.

In an effort to make the most of my summer and to ensure that my customers get the attention they deserve, I decided it was best to stop new development for <a href="http://www.mccormicktechnologies.com" target="_blank">my business</a> and scale down to just customer support for the next few months. I'm trying to tie up all of my remaining loose ends before I leave this weekend and I've already had to turn away new work, unfortunately.

This summer I will be living at <a href="http://www.breproperties.com/community/?property_code=pnw1243" target="_blank">The Trails of Redmond</a> apartments in Redmond with one roommate. My apartment complex is one block away from <a href="https://foursquare.com/venue/252432" target="_blank">Building 30</a>, which is where I will be working. Since I've decided to bike to work all summer, this will be really nice. The apartments look beautiful and come <a href="http://www.aboda.com/corporate_housing/property/Trails_of_Redmond" target="_blank">fully furnished</a>, making relocation a lot easier. I will also be a 20 minute bike ride from downtown Redmond and a short 30 minute bus ride from downtown Seattle.

I will be chronicling my internship throughout the summer, so check back for updates. I am really excited to be at Microsoft this summer. I'm also thrilled to be a member of the Microsoft Lync team. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates" target="_blank">Bill Gates</a> himself had this to say about Lync:
<blockquote>This is probably the most important thing to happen for the office worker since the PC came along.</blockquote>
Microsoft is on the <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/applications/microsoft-lync-2010-unified-communications-comes-age-442" target="_blank">forefront</a> of voice and video communications technology and it seems that I will be joining the team at a very <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703730804576314854222820260.html" target="_blank">exciting time</a>. With Microsoft's recent acquisition of Skype, I have a feeling I will be  seeing some very interesting things happening this summer.
