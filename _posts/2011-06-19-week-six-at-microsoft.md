It’s been a while since I [last updated][1]. As it stands today, I am heading into my sixth week here at [Microsoft][2]. I have been busy working away during the week and making the most of my time in the Seattle area on weekends. I’ve met a lot of new people over the last few weeks, both fellow interns and people I work with on my team.

A few weeks ago I got my first [Windows Phone][5] on [Verizon][6]. I waited in line at the Microsft-only Verizon Store on the morning it came out and got a great price on the [device][7]. Unlike [last year’s interns][8], my device was not free, but I did get to upgrade early and paid next to nothing for it. It’s a great phone and, my employer aside, it’s a great operating system. I honestly think that if more consumers went and used a Windows Phone 7 device, they would fall in love with it.

Last week my girlfriend, [Libby][9], came to visit me! She flew out on Tuesday night and stayed until Sunday morning. I had to work on Wednesday and Thursday, but my manager let me have Friday off since I had to work on the Memorial Day holiday. We spent a lot of time in downtown Seattle, at [Pike Place Market][10], visited the [Space Needle][11], and went to a [Seattle Sounders][12] game. We also visited [Microsoft City Center][13] in downtown Bellevue, which has a [gorgeous 26th floor patio][14]. On Thursday night we ate at [Canlis][15], a [beautiful][16] restaurant in Seattle that overlooks [Lake Union][17]. It was one of the [best meals][18] that I’ve ever had. We also visited [Snoqualmie Falls][19], about a 30 minute drive from Redmond. Because of all the runoff from the late snow and early rains, the waterfall is [particularly active this year][20]. I had a great time with her here, but I’m looking forward to seeing her again when I head home for Connor’s graduation party in mid-July.

Lately, I’ve been using the [Pro Sports Club][21] almost every night. Some friends and I meet up to play racquetball and I usually swim afterwards. On Friday last week we had a team morale event, Office Goes to the Movies. I saw [Green Lantern in 3D][22] on Friday morning. It was great to take a break from work and get to know my team a little better. On Friday night I went to a party at my [friend’s apartment][23] in Bellevue. They had a beautiful patio on the roof of their apartment complex, so we had a barbecue and watched the sunset with [Mount Rainier][24] in the distance.

This week I have my first Core Design Review on Monday, where I will be meeting with my team, my customers, and the stakeholders for my feature to present my proposed design. I have already met with most of these attendees to get feedback, so hopefully tomorrow will just be a review for everyone and I can just get everyone together to sign off on things. On Tuesday, I have my [Checkpoint Review][27] with my manager. This is the halfway point for my internship, where my manager and I will discuss my progress thus far and review the commitments that I made at the beginning of the summer to ensure that I am on track. At the end of the meeting, my manager will make a decision of whether or not I am “performing at a level that would indicate future success in a professional position” or if I need to make some improvements.

Hopefully this week will go as planned, I’m sure it will. Next weekend my friends and I are going to the Seattle Sounders game, along with a group of other interns, thanks to Microsoft. Then next week, my family is in town for a week to celebrate my mom’s birthday, the Fourth of July, and my 21st birthday. I am really looking forward to seeing my family in the next couple of weeks!
