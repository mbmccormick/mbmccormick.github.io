title: Remove OEM Login Screen Wallpaper on Windows 7
excerpt:
  If you follow me on Twitter, then I'm sure you're aware of my current computer difficulties. Long story short, Dell sent someone out to replace my motherboard and hard drive and now I'm left with a fresh copy of Windows 7 that I need to restore to my working standards. One of those standards is removing the Dell wallpaper from the Windows 7 login screen. To do that, you just need to modify the following registry entry. Just change this DWORD value from 1 to 0.
