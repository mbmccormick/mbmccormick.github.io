title: New Employee Orientation (NEO)
excerpt: 
  Today was my very first day at Microsoft. A lot happened during New Employee Orientation (NEO), so I will just run you through my whole day. This morning, I had to return my rental car from this weekend. So I drove down to Avis to drop it off and while I was there I ran into two other interns who were starting today as well, so we made small talk. They asked how I was getting from there to Building 92, where orientation was, and I said that my two friends from school are going to pick me up and I offered them a ride.

Today was my very first day at Microsoft. A lot happened during New Employee Orientation (NEO), so I will just run you through my whole day. This morning, I had to return my rental car from this weekend. So I drove down to Avis to drop it off and while I was there I ran into two other interns who were starting today as well, so we made small talk. They asked how I was getting from there to <a href="https://foursquare.com/venue/759468" target="_blank">Building 92</a>, where orientation was, and I said that my two friends from school are going to pick me up and I offered them a ride. Once my friends arrived, all five of us packed into their car and we drove to Building 92 to park and get started with orientation.

We also received some Microsoft swag- a free bag full of stuff like a water bottle, our lunch card, informational handouts, pens, paper, etc. After we received our materials, we then headed upstairs to fill out some online forms and verify our employment authorization. Then we had our badge pictures taken and we turned in our employment confirmation forms and filled out some other online forms.

The rest of the day was spent in a large conference room in Building 92, where we discussed the onboarding process, Microsoft's mission and strategy, the organizational structure, values and culture, corporate citizenship, performance management, commitment setting, peer mentoring, perks of working at Microsoft, transportation system, network access, legal, safety and security, and tools and resources to help us get started. The NEO staff did a fantastic job at getting this information across and helping us network with other interns. The were really energetic and did a great job at reassuring us that Microsoft is a great place work, to say the least.

About mid-way through the day, we broke for lunch and ate in the Commons, Microsoft's stunning <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoft/2009086103_microsoftcampus20.html" target="_blank">on-campus mall</a> with dozens of local restaurants, phone stores, bike shops, furniture stores, salons, post office- you name it, it's probably there. After lunch we learned some new Microsoft terminology, for example "http://" is pronounced "whack whack" here. So "http://interns" is pronounced "whack whack interns", not sure if this is just an intern prank or if they actually do this. Towards the end of the day, we had our intern class picture (all 193 of us, the largest class so far this summer). And finally, we turned in our temporary badges and received our full-time badges, a free mug, and were given our manager's contact information and building assignments for tomorrow morning.

After NEO I went to the <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/en_US/home" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a> to look at all the cool stuff they had there, including the restricted-access software store. Every Microsoft product is available for employees to purchase at a very discounted rate. That place is awesome, I am definitely stopping by there tomorrow to get some t-shirts and stuff. My mentor asked me to stop by today for a brief introduction, so I took a shuttle over to <a href="https://foursquare.com/venue/252432" target="_blank">Building 30</a>, where I will be working, to meet him. We talked about our team and where I will be working, and showed me a brief presentation about the <a href="http://lync.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Lync</a> product. Tomorrow morning I will get my workstation setup and get familiar with our systems. At the end of the day, I walked back to my apartment, it only took me about 5-10 minutes.

For dinner, my friends from school and I met up with some other interns at their apartment in Bellevue for a cookout and about 12 of us hung out over there for the night. I had a great time and I met a bunch of other Microsoft interns. Anyway, more details to come this week. Tomorrow is my first real day, and I also get to bike to work!
