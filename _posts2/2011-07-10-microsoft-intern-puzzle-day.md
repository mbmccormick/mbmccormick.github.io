Today was the annual [Microsoft Intern Puzzle Day](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoft/2009630759_microsoftinterns10.html) at Camp [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx). Our day started off at 9am with opening ceremonies at the Commons, where we met up with our teams and talked about the day's events. I was on a team of twelve people with my friends, my officemate, and a couple of other nice people that I met today. At the end of the morning presentation, all 800 of the interns that made up 72 teams went to their assigned "cabins" throughout the Microsoft campus, otherwise known as a conference room.

Once we got to our assigned location, we distributed our supplies and some of our team members went to do stuff like a scavenger hunt and other events, while myself and the rest of the team stayed at our cabin and worked on the ridiculously creative and difficult puzzles that [Microsoft Research][5] put together for us. The puzzles could be anything from [XOR][6]ing a binary string of musical notes played from a harmonica to reveal an answer, to disecting [peeps][7] looking for [resistor code][8] values that revealed another answer. We also had to be fluent in [braille][9], [flag semaphore][10] signalling, [morse code][11], Jupiter's moons, Greek history, and a wide range of other topics.

Throughout the day, I attended two "live puzzles" which took place at various locations on campus. The first one I did was called "Take a Hike" where my partner and I each received walkie-talkies and we had to split up in the woods on Microsoft's campus and navigated two different trails, stopping at designated signs, instructing the other person on what to write down and where to go next. After stopping at 15 waypoints, we returned to our starting point and assembled the letters we recorded to reveal "magnetic navigation system" which gave us the answer "compass", which we phoned to our team members at our cabin who confirmed, through the online tool, that this was correct. Later in the day, another team member and I attended the "Wet T-Shirt Contest" where I wore a pasta strainer with thumbtacks glued to the top as a helmet and my partner tossed water balloons at me. The goal was to break four water balloons on my helmet and for each balloon we broke, we got a clue. The clues were "snow, king, horseshoe, hermit" which gave us the answer "crab", which was also correct.

In the afternoon we continued to solve more puzzles and finally got enough puzzles solved to give us a hint on the [metapuzzle][14], which instructed us to go look "in tent by volleyball court east of mixer". So we ran over to the Commons and looked around the sand volleyball court, where we found a small tent hidden in the bushes, and inside we found instructions for another metapuzzle. Unfortunately, we ran out of time to solve the final meta-puzzle, as the day ended at 6pm. After we cleaned up our campsite, we returned to the Commons for closing ceremonies at 6:30pm where the winners were announced and the solutions to the puzzles were revealed. Our team finished in the top 36, which I thought was pretty good, considering how hard the puzzles were. It was a really great day and the Microsoft Research teams did a great job setting up this event for us!
