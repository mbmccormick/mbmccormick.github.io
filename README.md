## Website Design

Credit for the original design and inspiration of this goes to [Kyle Neath](http://warpspire.com). While many of his design elements are still in use in my website's current design, I have made the following changes to his code:

* Upgraded website layout to HTML5
* Added responsive stylesheet for tablets and smartphones
* Implemented Jekyll pagination
* Added Google search functionality

I've also added some more GitHub-style colors and icons to the design. All of the code for this version is now W3C valid and follows all HTML5 standards.
