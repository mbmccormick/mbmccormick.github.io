My name is Matt McCormick and I am a senior at <a href="http://www.purdue.edu" target="_blank">Purdue University</a> studying computer science, with a concentration in software engineering. I have a passion for technology, which drives my interest for software development and website design. I started my business, <a href="http://www.mccormicktechnologies.com" target="_blank">McCormick Technologies</a>, in January of 2009 as an entity through which to conduct my freelance work. More information about my clients and the services that I offer can be found on my business website.

This past summer I worked at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> in Redmond, WA in Microsoft Lync as a Program Manager Intern in the server platform team. I will be returning to Microsoft in the same role and for the same team next summer. I am also the Microsoft Ambassador for Purdue University.
