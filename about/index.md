My name is Matt McCormick and I'm a Program Manager at Microsoft and a Computer Science graduate from Purdue University. During the day, I work on datacenter automation at a global scale for the Office 365 Foundations Engineering team. At night, I'm a hacker, chef, gardener, dog lover, beer and wine connoisseur, and a bunch of other things. I'm married to a beautiful woman and we live together in Seattle with our crazy dog. She writes about our life [here](http://libbyandmatt.com). I often tweet about my adventures on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/mbmccormick) and I occasionally write nerdy things on this blog.

You can take a look at my open source projects on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/mbmccormick). If you see something you like, enjoyed one of my blog posts, or use one of my applications, share the love and [buy me a beer](https://cash.me/$mbmccormick)!
