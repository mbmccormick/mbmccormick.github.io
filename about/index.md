### My name is Matt McCormick.

I'm a Program Manager at Microsoft and a Computer Science graduate from Purdue University. I'm currently working on the Office 365 machine fabric at Microsoft, building automation that manages hardware maintenance and makes our datacenters more intelligent. I'm a Midwest transplant living in Seattle with my wife and our dog.
